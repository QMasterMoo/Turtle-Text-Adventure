Turtle-Text-Adventure
=====================

"The best text adventure game ever" - Turtle61

"Literally, 10/10" - Moomasterq

=====================

This is one of the many Turtle based games, coming after the best selling atari game, Turtle Laser.  Life starts as a simple turtle, but blossoms into something big.  Will purely be text based, and may have a very (and I mean very) basic graphics system added later in Version 2.0.
